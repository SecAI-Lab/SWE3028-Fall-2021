<h3> c. Description of each page  </h3>

<p>
	
a.	Cover page :
 Since it is the first screen that users face, We designed the logo ourselves because we thought we had to firmly convey the platform brand image.
<br>

b.	Start Page :
 This page is expressed in fancy graphics to roughly imply the functionality of our platform<br>
	<br>

c.	User Guide Page :
 For optimal UX, we made this page with Card UI. Every time user turn the page, the content and design are designed to be different. <br>

 This page is for new users who want to make an account for this service. Currently this includes four text or password boxes, and a submission button. <br>



e.	Login Page :
 To use the service, users need to sign in via this page. Among the information provided in the sign-up page, ID is unique for each user: thus, ID and password are needed to log in. Additionally, there is the button to the sign-up page for who doesn’t have an account for this service. <br>



f.	Find Location Page :
 This page is core function page. We connect with CNN model that we made ourselves.  <br>


g.	List Up page :
 This page shows the list of places serviced, by popularity. Popularity can be measured by daily, weekly, or monthly. Each place entry is clickable and shows a subpage for that place. <br>


h.	Upload Picture Page :
 This page is prepared for improving AI model, so the location information for the picture is necessary. The dropdown list for locations needed is served. <br>


 
i.	SNS Page :
On the SNS page, you can see recommendations for places shared by celebrities.


j.	My Page :
This is the own user page for a user logged in, which shows pictures uploaded by that user from find location page.
